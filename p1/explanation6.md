A map is used becasue is provides a O(1) lookup time and an O(1) deletion time. They 
also have an O(n) space complexity. Linked list were specified to be used. They have 
O(n) traversal, and an O(1) insertion time. They also have an O(n) space complexity.

Time:
union: O(n)
intersection: O(n)

Space:
union: O(n)
intersection: O(n)
