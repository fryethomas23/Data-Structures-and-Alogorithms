Task 0: Wost case, the script runs at O(n*log(n)). This is because of the use of 
sorted(), which uses timsort. Timsort has a worst case run time of O(n*log(n)).

Task 1: Worst case, the script runs at O(n) because it must loop through all of 
the data once.

Task 2: Worst case, the script runs at O(n) because it must loop through all of 
the data once.

Task 3: Task A worst case, the script runs at O(n) because it must loop through 
all of the data once. Task B worst case, the script runs at O(n*log(n)) because 
the data must be sorted at the end, which is done by the sorted() function using
timsort.

Task 4: Worst case, the script runs at O(n^2) because at worst, every number is 
in the data set is unique. And, every unique number must be compared to every 
entry in the data set.
